# Full-Stack Stock Trading Platform

## Overview
The Full-Stack Stock Trading Platform is a robust and scalable web application that enables users to trade stocks seamlessly. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, this platform allows users to buy and sell stocks and manage their portfolios. Currently, the market data does not update in real-time, but we plan to integrate real-time market data in the future. Transactions are currently simplified, allowing users to place orders and buy stocks without security measures, but we aim to implement secure transactions in upcoming updates.

## Features
- **Stock Trading**: Buy and sell stocks in real-time.
- **Live Market Data**: Fetch and display live stock prices.
- **Portfolio Management**: Track and manage user investments.
- **Transaction History**: View past trades and financial records.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, stocks, and platform settings.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
